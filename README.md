PANIC TYCOON
============

[![Front-End Build Status](https://ci.testling.com/Panic-Tycoons/panic-tycoon.png)](https://ci.testling.com/Panic-Tycoons/panic-tycoon)  
[![Back-End Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Panic-Tycoons/panic-tycoon.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Panic-Tycoons/panic-tycoon)

A game based on software engineering for the Trinity College Dublin 4th year CS4098 Programming Group Project module.

## Prerequisites 

* [node.js 0.10+](http://nodejs.org/download/) must be installed 
* A browser which shows green in the testling image above

### Installing Node.js 0.10

* Clone the latest version of the node version manager (`nvm`) from https://github.com/creationix/nvm using:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/creationix/nvm ~/.nvm
    ```

* Source the nvm.sh script using

    ```
    source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
    ```

* Optionally: Add `source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh` to the file `~/.bash_profile` to repeat this step when creating new shells (otherwise this will require a manual intervention)

* Switch to node 0.10 using `nvm install 0.10`

## Installation and Running

From root of project:

* Run `npm install` in root directory to fetch dependencies
* Run `npm test` in root directory to run unit tests if desired.
* Run `npm start` in root directory to launch web server.

### Installation Problems

If you experience installation problems, a goof plan is to remove the `node_modules` directory and do `npm install` again.


## Features

* Config Loading
    * Configuration is loaded from a `config.json` file in the application root. All values contained in this file are made available to any application component that imports it using the config loader. Individual flags can be specified (or overriden) on the command line, for example: `node index.js --test=50` would set a config variable named "test" to the value 50, or override the variable "test" if it already existed in `config.json`.
* Clickable Maps
	* A world map is loaded from the jvectormap library. It has selectable regions and offers a list of all the regions which have been selected. It is accessible from `index.html` in the root directory.
    * Each zone has a status display, which details the status as a percentage. It is viewable by hovering over an area.

* Process Simulator 
    * Simulates advancement of modules in individual chunks, scaled by number of developers.
	
## Tests

This project uses [travis](http://travis-ci.org) and [testling](http://ci.testling.com) to automate testing and ensure front-end compatibility and positive build-state on the backend.

### Test Coverage

To see the code coverage of the current test suite an external tool, `covert`, can be installed using `npm install -g covert` (may require sudo).

With covert, simply run `covert ./tests/*.js` to see percentage code coverage for the full suite, or specify a specific file or files for narrower results.
